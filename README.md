# Truth or backpropaganda? An empirical investigation of deep learning theory (https://openreview.net/forum?id=HyxyIgHFvr)
### ICLR2020_submission

This repository consists of code developed in order to explore empirically certain assertions about deep learning. Specifically, experiments in this repository examine local minimia in the loss surface, the norm of parameters, neural tagent kernals, and the rank of networks. The directories in this repository separate the code by topic.
