This repository consists of code developed in order to empirically investigate assertions from deep learning theory.  The associated paper can be found [here](https://arxiv.org/abs/1910.00359). Specifically, experiments in this repository examine local minima of the loss surface, weight decay, neural tangent kernels, and the rank of operators in networks. The directories in this repository are separated by topic.
